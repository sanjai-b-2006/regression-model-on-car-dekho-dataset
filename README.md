This project demonstrates the use of various regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Decision Tree Regressor And Boosting Techniques on the Car Dekho dataset.
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each model :

Linear Regression: A basic model that tries to find the best linear relationship between the features and the target variable.

Ridge Regression: An extension of linear regression that includes a regularization term to reduce overfitting.

Lasso Regression: Similar to ridge regression but uses L1 regularization, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression: Predicts the target variable by averaging the values of the k-nearest neighbors.

Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results to improve accuracy and control overfitting.

Decision Tree Regressor: A model that splits the data into different segments based on the feature values and makes predictions for each segment.
